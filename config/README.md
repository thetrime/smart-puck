You need three files in here to make the system work:

## wifi
This is a file with two lines. The first is your SSID. The second is your password. Easy.

## uprn
This is the unique property reference number. You can find yours at https://www.findmyaddress.co.uk/search
Note that the bin lights only work for Fife. If you live outside of Fife, a simple workaround is to move here.

## keys
These can be generated using the code in the knock-knock project. Eventually I will duplicate that code in here
